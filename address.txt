MAC ADDRESS
To communicate or transfer data from one computer to another, we need an address. 
In computer networks, various types of addresses are introduced; each works at a different layer. 
A MAC address, which stands for Media Access Control Address, is a physical address that works at the Data Link Layer. 
In this article, we will discuss addressing a DLL, which is the MAC Address. 

IP ADDRESS
An IP address or Internet Protocol address is a unique identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet. 
It is a set of numbers separated by dots, such as 192.155.12.1 1. 
The IP address serves two primary functions: network interface identification and location addressing 2.

The IP address is used to identify and communicate with other devices on the internet. 
When you request a web page or download a file, your computer sends a request to the server hosting the content. 
The server then sends the requested data back to your computer using your IP address to ensure that 
the data is delivered to the correct device.

PORTS
A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. 
Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system. 
Each port is associated with a specific process or service. Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between
 different kinds of traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages, for instance, 
 even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection.

HTTP METHODS
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

The GET Method
GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:

The POST Method
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:
